OnBoarding FrontEnd (UI) deployment instructions for Tomcat 8
-------------------------------------------------------------

1) Download Tomcat 8.0.x
2) Extract the tomcat files from zip files to a folder ... ex: tomcat-8-instance1
3) By default, tomcat server will run on 8080 port. Since OnBoarding API is deployed on this port, UI can be deployed on a different port.
4) Open server.xml file which is under the folder 'conf', where tomcat is installed.
5) Look for the following line ...
   <Server port="8001" shutdown="_SHUTDOWN_COMMAND_" debug="0">
   Change port to 8002 ...
6) Look for the following line ...
   <Connector port="8080" protocol="HTTP/1.1" ...
   Change port to 9100 ...
7) Save server.xml file
8) Set environment variable CATALINA_HOME to the folder tomcat-8-instance1, using following line.
   SET CATALINA_HOME="D:\tomcat-8-instance1"
9) Run startup.bat to start the server
10) Create a directory 'onboarding' under webapps directory
11) Place the OnBoarding UI distribution files under this directory
12) Now in the browser address bar enter http://localhost:9100/onboarding/# to bring up the onboarding UI.

Steps to create OnBoarding UI distribution
------------------------------------------

1) Open env.js file in visual studio code editor
2) Look for below line ...
   window.__env.FrontEndURL = 'http://localhost:3000/#';
   Change the value to 'http://192.168.1.197:9100/onboarding/#'
3) Look for below line ...
   window.__env.rootUrl = '';
   Change the value to '/onboarding'
4) Save env.js
5) From terminal in visual studio execute the following command
   gulp build
6) This will crate a 'dist' folder. This folder contains the distribution files. 
   Caution: Sometimes, this process might corrupt the generated css/js files. This will be evident when you bring up the UI and login, after deployment process is complete. In which case, execute the generation of distribution once again.
7) Copy the contents of the 'dist' folder to the <tomcat-instance>/webapps/onboarding directory.
8) Now in the browser address bar enter http://localhost:9100/onboarding/# to bring up the onboarding UI.
